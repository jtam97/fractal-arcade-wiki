title: About Me and the Fractal Arcade

## A bit about me!

I'm Justin, a software engineer, a CS/bioinformatics researcher, and a video game nerd! I love games but know little about what makes them tick, both in code and in enjoyment. So this is my exploration of unique algorithms and technical designs in games - sometimes beautiful, sometimes hacky, sometimes lazy - all fun!

## The Fractal Arcade

> Where beautiful algorithms meet playful design

The name "Fractal Arcade", at its root, was inspired by fractals and chaos theory, often associated with infinite procedural generation. Just like fractals, the controlled chaos and beauty in games can be found in the details.


## Games that inspired me to create Fractal Arcade:
- Dark Souls
- Path of Exile
- Breath of the Wild
- Marvel Rivals
