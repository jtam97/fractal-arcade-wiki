## The Fractal Arcade

> An algorithm must be seen to be believed.
> — *Donald Knuth*

The name **"Fractal Arcade"**, at its root, was inspired by fractals and chaos theory, often associated with infinite procedural generation. Just like fractals, the controlled chaos and beauty in games can be found in the details.

In this blog, I explore:
- 🧠 Computer science innovations
- 🎯 Game mechanics
- ✨ The brilliant combinations that make gaming so interesting

I'll also have some posts here that are pure scientific conceptualization and intuition for my own learning!

## 👋 A bit about me!

> I'm **Justin Tam**, a CS/bioinformatics researcher and PhD student, and a video game nerd! I love games but know little about what makes them tick. So this is my exploration of unique algorithms, innovative ideas and technical designs in games.

### My top 5 games of all time:

1. **Dark Souls 1** (and by extension, most of the souls-like games but if I included them, my top 5 would all be souls games)
2. **Modern Warfare 2019**
3. **League of Legends** (aram/arena only player nowadays)
4. **Valorant**
5. **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**

### 🎮 Current obsessions:

- **Battlefield 6**
- **Nightreign**
