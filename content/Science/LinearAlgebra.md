The basis of a coordinate system is the 1 unit vectors needed to map out every point in that space - i.e 1 unit for x and y maps out 2D system.

Span is all the points a combination of vectors can reach if you had any scalar value.

Linear combination -> Linear independence vs dependence
	- Linearly dependent means vectors that do not expand the span

**Linear Transformations**
Linear transformations means gridlines must be evenly spaced and parallel to be linear

A linear transformation of a vector can be described by the basis vectors using a*i + b*j. Interestingly, if the basis gets transformed, you can use the new coordinates of i and j to calculate the linear transformation of a vector.
