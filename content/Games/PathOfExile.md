title: Path of Exile - Same Map, Different Experience
---

I've been playing Path of Exile for years now - countless leagues and countless more characters. I'll give a basic rundown of the game, if you're familiar you can skip to the [algorithm](#algorithm) section.

## Gameplay

Path of Exile is a loot-based action RPG with an insanely complex build and item system that makes each character a project in itself. The main thing I'm going to focus on here is the unique map procedural generation. From my perspective as a player, the campaign is pretty cool but the maps specifically are what make the game special.


### Campaign Maps

The level design of campaign maps and endgame maps are interesting and unique, and on repeat playthroughs, you can see the level design elements change slightly but are still familiar. In a way, this type of map caters to casual players and more hardcore "speed runners" - maps are never identical so it doesn't feel stale, but the pathing is familiar enough that, once you've learned the map layout, you can move in a general direction and be confident you are going the right way.
